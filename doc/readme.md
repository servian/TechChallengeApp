The Servian tech challenge app is a golang application used for challenging candidates applying to work with Servian.

## Documentation structure

[readme.md](readme.md) - this file
[config.md](config.md) - how to configure the application

### Architecture Design Records (ADR)

Architectural decisions are recorded in the `adr` folder, details on why can be found in the [first entry](adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md)

Naming convention: `####-<decision title>` where the first 4 digits are iterated by 1 for each record.

## Tech Challenge Application

Single page application designed to be ran inside a container or on a vm (IaaS) with a postgres database to store data.

It is completely self contained, and should not require any additional dependencies to run.

## Install

1. Download latest binary from release
2. unzip into desired location
3. and you should be good to go

## Database setup

This application is backed by a postgres db. Use the `updatedb` command to create the database, tables, and seed with test data

### Supported versions

Tested against:

* PostgreSQL 9.6
* PostgreSQL 10.7

## Start server

update `conf.toml` with database settings (details on how to configure the application can be found in [config.md](config.md))

`TechChallengeApp updatedb` to create a database, tables, and seed it with test data. Use `-s` to skip creating the database and only create tables and seed data.

`TechChallengeApp serve` will start serving requests

## Interesting endpoints

`/` - root endpoint that will load the SPA

`/api/tasks/` - api endpoint to create, read, update, and delete tasks

`/healthcheck/` - Used to validate the health of the application

## Application Architecture

![architecture](images/architecture.png)

The application itself is a React based single page application (SPA) with an API backend and a postgres database used for data persistence. It's been designed to be completely stateless and will deploy into most types of environments, be it container based or VM based.

## Build from source

Pre-built releases are available so not many people need to look here.

### Requirements

Application currently bundles assets using [go.rice](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/)

#### Golang

Application is built using golang, this can be installed in many ways, go to [golang](https://golang.org/) to download the version that suits you.

#### Docker

If building using docker you need to have docker installed on your local machine. Download from the [docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Compiling the application locally

From the source repo:

run `build.sh` to download all the dependencies and compile the application

the `dist` folder contains the compiled web package

### Docker build using docker

To build a docker image with the application installed on it

`docker build . -t servian/techchallengeapp:latest`


### Pull Image from Dockerhub:

To pull a docker image pre-built

`docker pull servian/techchallengeapp:latest`

## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration is managed through circleci and the build on the master branch will create a new release when a new version is defined.

## Creating a new release

Releases are deployed and managed through github, it's an automated process that is executed through the CI solution

To create a new release, update `../cmd/root.go` with the new version and merge that into the master branch.

The commit message on the merge, will be the release message, so make sure it contains the release notes.

A tag will be created on the master branch if the build and release is successful.

We use semver for versioning, `major.minor.patch[-pre-release]` and the CI solution has been configured to take note of the `-pre-release` tag of the version and upload it as a pre-release in git if it's included. So to release a new full release, make sure to not include `-pre-release` and vice versa.

Builds will be produced for:

* MacOS (amd64)
* Linux (x86/amd64)
* Windows (x86/amd64)

#### Note
* If you are setting up the database using RDS, do not run the `./TechChallengeApp updatedb` command. Instead run `./TechChallengeApp updatedb -s` 



### John's comments

1. infrastructure
* terraform deployed infra on aws platform (terraform code in separate repo)
* ecr and esc for image repo and deployment environment
* psql docker running on ec2 as uat environment (I will use rds if it is prod environment for better scalability and availability)

2. Changes made to config.yml
* changed to version 2.1 to use orbs
* added two orbs option, aws-ecr and aws-ecs for image repo and deployment environment
* added deploy-uat stage to run on non master branches and associate the stage with uat deployment environment ( A prod deployment environment can be added into config.yml  )
* used deploy-uat stage without "Release if new version" to skip create release which is only allowed on master branch.  ( I got error messages when running this part on other branch and the pipeline will stop and skip the rest actions, assuming there is authentication requirement to create new release only on master branch)

3. questions:
* not sure how to use env var in conf.toml which includes dbpassword and host location, I tried to copy a same name file from s3 to replace the repo one, and also tried to sed to inject CircleCI environment vars, but failed either way. The pipeline just didn't recognize the new file or content and stick with the original. This is the most interesting part that I am looking forward to some instructions.
* command "updatedb" was still manually done, ecs task definition takes only one command, serve, in the entrypoint section.
