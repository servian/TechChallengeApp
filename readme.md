## Overview

This is the Servian DevOps Tech challenge. It uses a simple application to help measure a candidate's technical capability and fit with Servian. The application itself is a simple GTD Golang application that is backed by a Postgres database.

Servian provides the Tech Challenge to potential candidates, which focuses on deploying this application into a cloud environment of choice.

More details about the application can be found in the [document folder](doc/readme.md)
